                <h3>Defining Classic Cars</h2>

                <p>Classic cars are automobiles that possess a unique combination of age, design, and historical significance. While there is no universal consensus on the exact definition, various organizations and enthusiasts generally agree that a car becomes a classic after a certain number of years, typically around 20 to 25 years. This time frame allows the vehicle to develop a historical context, marking it as a representative of a specific era in automotive history.</p>

                <h3>Design Elements</h2>

                <p>One of the defining features of classic cars is their distinctive design, often characterized by elegant lines, intricate detailing, and a sense of craftsmanship that is sometimes lost in contemporary mass production. Classic cars hail from an era where each vehicle was a work of art, carefully sculpted by designers who prioritized aesthetics as much as functionality. These cars often boast unique features like chrome accents, sweeping fenders, and iconic grilles, contributing to their timeless charm.</p>
