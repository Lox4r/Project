                <p>The four essential components of an automobile are the chassis, the engine, the transmission system, and the body. Without these, an automobile would not be able to work or function at all.</p>

                <h3>Chassis</h3>
                <p>The chassis of an automobile incorporates all the moving parts of a car. It includes the frame, suspension system, axles, and wheels as the main components. The frame is the skeleton of the vehicle, supporting the weight of the engine, transmission, and car body. The suspension system, with springs and shock absorbers on each corner, absorbs vibrations, making the ride smoother. The axles receive power from the engine, rotating the wheels while supporting the car’s weight. The wheels are crucial for the car to travel at any speed.</p>
                
                <h3>Engine</h3>
                <p>The engine is the source of power to an automobile and is the most important part because it enables the movement of the car. Most cars have some variation of the internal combustion engine that uses petrol (gasoline) as fuel. Another type is the compression ignition engine using diesel as fuel. The engine consists of fixed cylinders and moving pistons. All engines need air, fuel, and spark to operate. The energy is made from igniting the air and fuel mixture. The expanding combustion gases push the piston, rotating the crankshaft. Through a system of gears in the powertrain, this motion drives the vehicle’s wheels. The type of engine determines the horsepower of the car and the fuel consumption, which is the efficiency of the engine.</p>
                
                <h3>Transmission System</h3>
                <p>After the power is created in the engine, it must travel through the transmission system. The transmission’s job is to send the power from the engine to the wheels of the car. The system is made up of the clutch, gearbox, differential, and axle. The clutch engages and disengages the engine to the transmission itself, making it possible to change gears. The gearbox, with the gear train, increases torque when needed and changes gears to decrease the RPM (rotations per minute) of the engine while the car accelerates. The propeller shaft transmits the power output from the gearbox to the axle. The motion of the propeller shaft is fed into the differential, which is 90 degrees to the axle. The main purpose of the differential is to have the wheels turn at different speeds while the car is turning. The last part of the transmission system is the axle. The axle receiving power is called the ‘live’ axle, and the one not receiving power is called a ‘dead’ axle. Its purpose is to turn the wheels of the car, the final step of transmitting power from the engine into the tires on the road.</p>
                
                <h3>Car Body</h3>
                <p>The last essential component of an automobile is the car body. This forms the shape of the car, provides room for passengers and storage, and houses the systems of the automobile. The body typically consists of front and rear bumpers, side skirts, spoilers, and hoods of cars. They are designed differently depending on the purpose of the car, determining the aerodynamics, safety, and the overall look of the car. This is where all external features of the car are displayed such as the head and tail lights, engine grill and hood, the storage trunk, and all windows.</p>
